# GNAR-edge-model
Code and synthetic data experiments for the paper "GNAR-edge model: A network autoregressive model for networks with time varying edge weights", arXiv pre-print:

Main code (ar_ts_edges.R script) for GNAR-edge model is modification of original GNAR model code by Knight et al. 2019, to address the problem when time series are observed on the edges of a network.

Script sim_gnar_edge_1st_sec.R contains code for simulation experiments of section 5.1 of the main paper, and script sim_gnar_edge_2nd_sec.R contains code for simulation experiments of section 5.2 of the main paper.
